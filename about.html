				<h1>Hawaii Architecture</h1>

				<p>The optimal Hawaii residential design is unique for each site, microclimate and the client's needs, preferences and budget. </p>

				<p>Contemporary Hawaii architectural design has evolved organically and is influenced by many architectural styles that respond to the climate and history of Hawaii including early Polynesian/Island Style, Japanese/Asian, Plantation Style, Mediterranean and Modern Island Architecture.</p>

				<p>Hawaii residential architecture includes the exciting interplay of interior and exterior environments responding to the tremendous natural beauty, wonderful climate, and flowing indoor-outdoor lifestyle that Hawaii provides. Hawaii homes benefit from large open spaces with doorways and windows that provide natural ventilation while opening to covered lanais and the surrounding landscaping and views.</p>

				<p>Construction methods and materials must respond to Hawaii's intense sunlight, wind, rain, humidity extremes and other factors that are important for the long term integrity of the building.</p>
