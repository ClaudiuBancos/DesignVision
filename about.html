				<h1>Hawaii Architecture</h1>

				<p>The optimal Hawaii residential design is unique for each site, microclimate and the client's needs, preferences and budget. </p>

				<p>Contemporary Hawaii architectural design has evolved organically and is influenced by many architectural styles that respond to the climate and history of Hawaii including early Polynesian Island Style, Japanese/ Asian, Plantation Style, Mediterranean and Modern Island Architecture.</p>

				<p>Fine Hawaii architecture form and function responds to the tremendous natural beauty, wonderful climate, and flowing indoor-outdoor lifestyle. Hawaii homes benefit from large open spaces with roll-back doorways and windows opening to views and providing excellent airflow, large shading overhangs and covered lanais that seamlessly connect with the interior living space while incorporating high tech automation, security, energy management and climate control including solar power, energy storage, automated shading and screening, air conditioning and air purification.</p>

				<p>Construction methods, materials, water proofing and structural design by McCall Architects Inc. Includes our 33 years of Hawaii design and construction experience that respond to Hawaii's intense sunlight, north-eastern trade winds, southern Kona winds and occasional hurricane winds, heavy rains, flash floods, humidity extremes, high salt air, the rare earthquake, insects, mold and vog and other factors that are important for owners, building and property.</p>

				<p>McCall Architects Inc. has been designing and building luxury Hawaii residences for over 33 years</p>
